UPDATE: No more NFZ stuff here.

Reasons: 

1.) I don't want people flying in NFZ 

2.) It did not work consistently

If you want to fly in a RED NFZ AND are allowed to AND have problems with them activating your account to do so you should fallback to the firmware parameter change. This was never meant to help people fly in RED NFZ!

Disclaimer:


I am not responsible for any damage done! Use your brain and all will be fine!

Also i will not include any apk to this git! You have to do everything yourself, if you cannot you should not play with stuff like this!

1.) make sure you have dialog installed: sudo apt-get install dialog

2.) Download needed tools manually or run the script provided. 

2a) Download apktool, rename it to apktool.jar and save it to tools folder:
https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/

2b) Download sign.jar from https://github.com/appium/sign/raw/master/dist/sign.jar and put it in tools folder

3.) Get the apk to modify, i suggest downloading from google play, to do so install this chrome extension:
https://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/

4.) RunMe.sh
